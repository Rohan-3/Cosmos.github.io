<br><h1 style="color:White;">What is Cosmos? </h1> 

         <p style="color:Violet;"> Cosmos is originally a Greek word, meaning both "order" and "world," because the ancient Greeks thought that the world was perfectly harmonious and impeccably put in order.Also the universe seen as a well-ordered whole.<br> For example :
"He sat staring deep into the void, reminding himself of man's place in the cosmos"<br></p>

 <h1 style="color:White;">What does Cosmology mean? </h1> 
<br>
 <p style="color:Violet;">Cosmology is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and philosophical systems have a cosmology.</p><br>

When cosmology is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

2)Only about 4.9% of the mass-energy of the Universe is atoms: the kind of stuff you, me, the stars and galaxies are made of (and, of that, only half has been spotted with telescopes). About 26.8% of cosmic mass-energy is invisible dark matter, revealed because it tugs with its gravity on the visible stuff.<br>
